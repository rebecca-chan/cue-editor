# Rebecca Chan's Vimeo Coding Challenge


Please look in the public folder for index.html! Thanks!

This Vimeo Cue Editor is created as a Single Page Application using only vanilla JS

Allows user to add cues at specific times - by seconds

Displays added cues to allow removal

Cues are displayed as an overlay on the player as text
Used own styling, but followed sample as a guide.

Did not use native API Player methods for cue Activity

Allows user to change video based off ID search
